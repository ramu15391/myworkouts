Typescript:

works well on large projects -> to handle complexity while using js
ts transpiled to js -> a suuport to handle larger projects
classes and inheritance
compile time error report
works well with gulp

compile ts to js, broswer can't read ts

interpreted language-> less time, memory -> no object code generating
but error find only on run time
ts overcomes this by showing error before transpilation

static typing prevents the invalid value passed over functions
readability, compile time error, modularity, oops, open source,
cross platform

 Intellisense and refactoring supported in more ide for ts

ECMA - JS, TS

TS datatype:-

let a:number=9;
string,any,array

let arr:string[]=["8","l"];
let arr: Array<string> = ['l','k'] accept string
let arr:any[]=[]'l',9,true] -> accepts array of any datatype

Array utility function such as push index are similar as in js
